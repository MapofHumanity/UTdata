        "description": "The 'Bastille' is the main student building of the\nUniversity of Twente. The building houses student organisations and student\nentrepreneurs, as well as services such as the student service centre and\nstudent counselling. The 'Bastille' also houses the Student Union, the umbrella\nstudent organisation of the University of Twente, to which over a hundred study-,\nsports-, and social clubs are associated. Last but not least the 'Vestingbar'\nis also located in the Bastille. This student bar is open every day of the\nyear, and is run by students. You might visit de 'Vestingbar' as well to join a\nparty or to watch a movie. Architecture by Piet\nBlom & Robert Winkel \n\n\n\n\n\nThe building was instantly baptised the 'Bastille'\nbecause of its resemblance with the exterior of the famed Parisian prison. Upon\nentering, visitors are overwhelmed by a carefully orchestrated chaos. Piet Blom\ncreated a labyrinth inside, with twelve mezzanines, low walls, niches, and\nsteps, all of which are intended to encourage coincidental encounters. Robert Winkel\ntransformed it into an open building. ",

In this laboratory, research is conducted on the scale of nanometres;\nthe scale of atoms and molecules. A nanometre is one million times smaller than\na millimetre. Research on such small particles sets high demands to a building.\nTemperature, incidence of light and air humidity are to be kept at a constant\nlevel. Even the smallest vibration can have disastrous results. Because dust\nparticles can also be fatal to nano products in the making, the nanolab has\n1000m2 of cleanrooms and the researchers wear protective clothing\nand gloves. Researchers in the lab work on challenging projects, like for\ninstance smart materials for solar cells, a pill that can trace bowel cancer or\ncomplete laboratories no larger than a stamp.
