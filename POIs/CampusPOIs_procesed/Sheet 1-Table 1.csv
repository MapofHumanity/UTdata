This building dates from the heyday of the New Objectivity. The architecture
is proud, with clean, imposing lines and few ties to the surroundings.
Initially, Van Tijen wanted to put the building on legs, inspired as he was by
the famous architect Le Corbusier. The building was given an energy-saving skin
in 2000; hence its new name 'Spiegel' (Mirror).";Buildings;;;http://campusapp.webhare-test.utsp.utwente.nl/.uc/ic9/acb9260103db046d0035cbf403723b0b007b14cd030701c13c03000080.jpg;http://beeldbank.utwente.nl/beeldbank/start/allematerialen/Gebouwen/Spiegel?fc=browse;http://campusapp.webhare-test.utsp.utwente.nl/.uc/i9e/53cec30103db046d0035cbf403723b0b007b14cd030701c1da00da0080.jpg;

cutting-edge laboratories for nanotechnology. It has been designed by Jan
Hoogstad. In this laboratory, research is conducted on the scale of nanometres;
the scale of atoms and molecules. A nanometre is one million times smaller than
a millimetre. Research on such small particles sets high demands to a building.
Temperature, incidence of light and air humidity are to be kept at a constant
level. Even the smallest vibration can have disastrous results. Because dust
particles can also be fatal to nano products in the making, the nanolab has
1000m2 of cleanrooms and the researchers wear protective clothing
and gloves. Researchers in the lab work on challenging projects, like for
instance smart materials for solar cells, a pill that can trace bowel cancer or
complete laboratories no larger than a stamp. The MESA+ Nanolab is connected to
the 'Carré' building and doesn't have an own entrance.
