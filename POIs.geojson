        "description": "The MESA+ Nanolab is among the world's most\ncutting-edge laboratories for nanotechnology. It has been designed by Jan\nHoogstad. In this laboratory, research is conducted on the scale of nanometres;\nthe scale of atoms and molecules. A nanometre is one million times smaller than\na millimetre. Research on such small particles sets high demands to a building.\nTemperature, incidence of light and air humidity are to be kept at a constant\nlevel. Even the smallest vibration can have disastrous results. Because dust\nparticles can also be fatal to nano products in the making, the nanolab has\n1000m2 of cleanrooms and the researchers wear protective clothing\nand gloves. Researchers in the lab work on challenging projects, like for\ninstance smart materials for solar cells, a pill that can trace bowel cancer or\ncomplete laboratories no larger than a stamp. The MESA+ Nanolab is connected to\nthe 'Carré' building and doesn't have an own entrance. ",
