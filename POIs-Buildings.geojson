In this laboratory, research is conducted on the scale of nanometres; the scale of atoms and molecules. A nanometre is one million times smaller than a millimetre. Research on such small particles sets high demands to a building. Temperature, incidence of light and air humidity are to be kept at a constant level. Even the smallest vibration can have disastrous results. Because dust particles can also be fatal to nano products in the making, the nanolab has 1000m2 of cleanrooms and the researchers wear protective clothing and gloves. Researchers in the lab work on challenging projects, like for instance smart materials for solar cells, a pill that can trace bowel cancer or complete laboratories no larger than a stamp. The MESA+ Nanolab is connected to the 'Carr√©' building and doesn't have an own entrance. ",
